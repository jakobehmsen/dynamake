	<h2>What is Dynamake about?</h2>
	<p>
	Dynamake is an attempt to envision, design, and implement an interactive code extrinsic programming environment. 
	This environment is to require only little configuration effort before getting the hands dirty.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
	<h2>What is Dynamake not about?</h2>

	<p>
	There is no aspiration of developing a programming environment for solving any kind of problem. 
	Instead, the environment is developed in an open-ended, experimental, and intuitive manner with a focus on the fundamentals.
	</p>

<div class="box">
	<h2>Why was this project started?</h2>

	<p>
	There were/are many reasons motivating this project. Lets look at a couple of'em.
	</p>
	<p>
	Most popular programming environments seem to dichotomize programs and processes simply by centering around code. What if one attempts to not adopt this dichotomy?
	</p>
	<p>
	Most popular programming environments are oriented around some sort of text-based, or similarly structered, programming language. What if no language is available at all - how does one program?
