		<div data-define="Programming environment">
			A programming environment should be perceived as an environment which supports composing systems and setting up their reaction patterns whichever means crystalize such an environment.
		</div>
		<div data-define="Dynamake">
			<span> <span data-mention="Dynamake">Dynamake</span> </span> is an attempt to envision, design, and implement an interactive code extrinsic <span data-mention="Programming environment">programming environment</span>. This environment is to require only little configuration effort before getting the hands dirty. In contrast to most programming environments, <span> <span data-mention="Dynamake">Dynamake</span> </span> is supposed to be a self-sufficient <span data-mention="Programming environment">programming environment</span> integrable with the "outer world".
			There are <span data-mention="Sources of inspirations">many sources of inspiration</span> driving this project.
			<span data-mention="Dynamake">Dynamake</span> is centered around the concept of <span data-mention="Model">models</span> and tools to interact with these <span data-mention="Model">models</span>. It is hoped that tools at some point, themselves, are represented using <span data-mention="Model">models</span>.
			A general design strategy is to attempt to <span data-mention="The merging of program and process">merge the concept of program and process</span> in strict sense - rather adopting <span data-mention="The program/process dichotomy">the program/process dichotomy</span>.
		</div>
		<div data-define="Model">
			A model should be perceived as a sensitive entity observing its surroundings constantly where each observation may provoke a reaction. One of the more tacit examples of this, is <span data-mention="Derivations">deriving models from other models</span>.
		</div>
		<div data-define="Sources of inspirations">
			So much experimentation has been performed on software systems and their potential crystalizations. Especially the 60's and 70's seem like golden decades of such work. One can't avoid being inspired from the great work done in this era. 
			One of the major examples here is the mother of all GUIs: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad">Sketchpad</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland">Ivan Sutherland</a> in 1963 - an incomprehensible leap within computer graphics and user interfaces.
		</div>
		<div data-define="Network usage">
			Using Dynamake across a network is not particularly well-defined yet. However, a vague driver of this aspect is context sensitivity and implicit recognition of Dynamake instances in the surroundings - whatever "surroundings" (and "Dynamake instances" for that matter) implies. Further, no configuration of connections to central servers should be necessary.
		</div>
		<div data-define="The merging of program and process">
			Uniting program and process, as concepts, into a single concept is definitely an old idea which has been incarnated in many forms to many different degrees. 
			In relation to software, one of many examples are the original perceptions of object oriented programming where objects were thought of as <a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en">"...being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages"</a>.
		</div>
		<div data-define="The program/process dichotomy">
			This dichotomy is concerned with separating programs from processes, where processes are seen as running programs. This separation has implicated <span data-mention="The program/process dichotomy issues">a couple of less-than-good effects</span>.
		</div>
		<div data-define="The program/process dichotomy issues">
			<ul>
				<li>
					One of the bigger issues with this dichotomy is that it has been propogated through many layers of software and hardware. Especially the popular OS's have taken a big hit on this with heavy weight, and non-scalable, processes where the end-users have become hostages of this phenomena. Programs are basically just seen as a special kind of file where files are completely passive elements in themselves. Processes are usually transient in nature and any long-term persistence parts are stored in files some way or another and then reloaded each time the processes are started. A special case of processes are services (still, usually, transient) which are loaded each time an OS is booted. Instead, an OS could just always be running; rather than booting one would just simply continue. This is by no means a new idea and attempts of such an OS has been made on multiple occasions. Of course, like the best user interface, the best OS is none.
				</li>
				<li>
					Another issue is that separating programs from their processes has provoked databases to become necessary evils. Before one even decides that long-term persistence is necessary for a software system, a need to (continously and awkwardly) integrate to an external database system of one form or another becomes the first step of such a practically essential property of a system. Such an integration really shouldn't be necessary - at least at the beginning of the development of a software system.
				</li>
				<li>
					Hardware has been affected by having the concept of memory and the concept of processor incarnated with only little overlap; memory does little processing and processers have little memory. An overlap is essential among these concepts for doing computation and it could be interesting to see computers only consisting of incarnations of a concept merged more or less equally of these two concepts.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div data-define="Derivations">
			A model can be derived from another model. A model, from which other models are derived from, is called a master. Initially, a derived model seems like a traditional copy. However, as changes are made to its master, these changes are implicitly reflected in the derived model without affecting the local history in the derived model. Basically, this kind of relation works by the masters forwarding changes in their local history to their derivations, which then observe that there are new changes to apply and then update according to the newly observed forwarded changes.<div style="clear=both"></div>
			When <span data-mention="Network usage">network support is implemented</span> this feature is supposed to be streamless; meaning no difference should exist whether changes are propogated within the same OS process, the same machine, or the same surroundings.
		</div>
		<div data-define="Required configuration">
			A <a href="http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">Java Runtime Environment</a> is required to start playing with <span data-mention="Dynamake">Dynamake</span>.
			Alas, currently, there is no ready-built release available, but such a release is planned to be made and published on <a href="https://github.com/jakobehmsen/dynamake/releases">GitHub</a> autumn 2014. 
			However, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a> can be used to build such a release relatively easy getting the sources on <a href="https://github.com/jakobehmsen/dynamake">GitHub</a> using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.<div style="clear=both"></div>
			There is no need for setting up a database of any sort to start persisting your software and their changes because <span data-mention="Dynamake">Dynamake</span> implicitly does this for you.

			<div class="title">What is Dynamake not about?</div>
			<div class="content">
			There is no aspiration of developing a programming environment for solving every kind of problem. 
			Instead, the environment is developed in an open-ended, experimental, and intuitive manner with a focus on a platform for making software.

			<div class="title">Why was this project started?</div>
			<div class="content">
			There were/are many reasons motivating this project. Lets look at a couple of'em.<div style="clear=both"></div>
			Most popular programming environments seem to dichotomize programs and processes simply by centering around code. What if one attempts to not adopt <span data-mention="The program/process dichotomy">this dichotomy</span>?<div style="clear=both"></div>
			Most popular programming environments are oriented around some sort of text-based, or similarly structered, programming language. What if no language is available at all - how does one program?

			<div class="title">What is the current state of Dynamake?</div>

			Dynamake is a rather new project, started April 2014, but some of the envisioned attributes are starting to emerge. There is <span data-mention="Required configuration">little configuration required</span> to start trying out <span data-mention="Dynamake">Dynamake</span>.
