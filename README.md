dynamake
========

Dynamake is an interactive visual programming environment. 

More specifically, Dynamake is an attempt to provide a syntax-less programming environment. A good balance between a syntax-inherent text-based keyboard-oriented approach versus a visual syntax-less approach is an overall goal.
